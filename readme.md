# Magical Arena

This is a simple simulation of a magical arena where two players fight each other. Each player has health, strength, and attack attributes. Players attack each other in turns until one of them dies.

## Setup

1. Unzip the provided zip file to your desired location.
2. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the unzipped directory.

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, execute the following command:
```sh
node arena.js
```
This will start the fight between two predefined players and output the fight details to the console.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:
```sh
npm test
```
This will run the unit tests for the `Player`, `Die`, and `Arena` classes using Mocha and assert.

## Code Explanation

### Player Class

- **Constructor**: Initializes a new player with name, health, strength, and attack attributes.
- **isAlive**: Returns `true` if the player's health is greater than 0.
- **takeDamage**: Reduces the player's health by the given damage, ensuring it doesn't drop below 0.

### Die Class

- **Constructor**: Initializes a new die with a given number of sides.
- **roll**: Simulates rolling the die and returns a random number between 1 and the number of sides.

### Arena Class

- **Constructor**: Initializes the arena with two players and two 6-sided dice (one for attacking and one for defending).
- **startFight**: Starts the fight between the two players, continuing until one of them dies. Alternates attacks between players each round.
- **getFirstAttacker**: Determines the first attacker based on the current health of the players or randomly if they have equal health.

## Example Output

```sh
Player A attacks Player B
Player A rolls 5 for attack (Damage: 50)
Player B rolls 2 for defense (Defended: 20)
Player B takes 30 damage
Player B health is now 70
Player B attacks Player A
Player B rolls 4 for attack (Damage: 20)
Player A rolls 3 for defense (Defended: 15)
Player A takes 5 damage
Player A health is now 45
...
The winner is Player B
